# what is a set? a set in mathematics is a organized collections of objects and can be represented in either set-builder form or roster form. In Python, sets are similar to lists, but they contain only unique elements. Python has a built-in method to create sets: set()
set1 = set()
# printing the set
print(type(set1))
